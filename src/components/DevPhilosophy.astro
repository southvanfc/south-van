    <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Our focus is long-term player development, not a win-now mentality. We aim
      to build technically strong, thoughtful players who understand the game
      and their role within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training across ability levels creates competitive environments where
      players are challenged daily, advanced players are pushed to lead, and the
      overall standard continues to rise.
